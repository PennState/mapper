= mapper

The `mapper` project provides a name mapper that's compatible with The
`Go` language conventions, where either `Pascal Case` or `Camel Case` are
recommended.  This mapper can perform transalation to and from the
following formats:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case[Camel case]
- [Kebab case]
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case[Pascal case]
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case[Snake case]

With this mapper, the parser isn't dependent upon the input format so
you can pass any of above four styles into the function.

When specifying the output format of the mapper, be aware that both the
`Snake Case` and `Kebob Case` mappers can be configured to generate
upper-case or lower-case characters (yielding six output formats).

Also note that one caveat to `Go`'s recommendations is that acrynyms
should be left capitalized.  This complicates the mapping process a bit
when mapping back to `Go` compatible names.
